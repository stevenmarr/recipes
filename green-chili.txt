Ingredients

25 fresh Pueblo green chiles or 5 (4 1/2-ounce) cans green chiles
1 stick of butter or margarine, plus more for sauteing pork
3 pounds pork, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
2 large white onions, cut into 1/2-inch dice
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 teaspoons dried oregano
2 teaspoons granulated garlic
6 large tomatoes, cut into 1/2-inch dice
2 (14 1/2-ounce) cans diced tomatoes
3 fresh jalapenos, diced, optional for added heat
1 cup flour

Directions

If roasting your own chiles: Preheat an outdoor grill to high. Place the Anaheim chiles on the grill and cook, turning to cook evenly, until the skins blister and blacken. Remove from the grill and place in a plastic bag. Seal the bag and let the chiles stand for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the skin, stems and seeds and chop into 1/4-inch pieces.

Heat some butter in a large pot and add the cubed pork. Cook about15 minutes, and then add the onions and spices. Cook on low heat, stirring occasionally. When the pork has cooked through, add the fresh tomatoes, canned tomatoes, green chiles and jalapenos, if using. Stir occasionally.

After 5 minutes, add 8 cups water. Bring to a low boil. Stir occasionally. Increase the heat and bring the chili to a rolling or high boil.

In separate pan, melt the butter or margarine and whisk in the flour, stirring until creamy.

Slowly add the roux to the chili, stirring constantly, and shut off the heat. Continue to stir so that the roux is evenly distributed. (Roux amount can be adjusted depending on desired consistency or thickness.)

Let stand 5 minutes and serve in a bowl or smothered!
